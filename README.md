#  Spotify Data Analysis — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Spotify music data.

---

##  **Project Overview**

**Objective:**  
To understand key trends and patterns in Spotify’s music dataset, focusing on song popularity, artists, genres, track features, and how these influence streaming numbers.

Key questions explored:
- Which genres and artists dominate the charts?
- What audio features (tempo, loudness, danceability, etc.) correlate with song popularity?
- How do streams vary by genre, artist, or release year?
- Are there patterns that help predict what makes a song popular on Spotify?
